# Meatyceiver 2

As some of you may know, Meatyceiver 2 was an extremely poorly coded mod.

At this point, while I wish to continue it, the codebase is untenable.

So, I have archived the old repository and started from scratch. This will be versions 0.4.0 and above.

This is in development; it is not working yet.

If you are looking for a working version, [check out the 0.3.x branch.](https://github.com/potatoes1286/Meatyceiver2-Redux/tree/0.3.x)
